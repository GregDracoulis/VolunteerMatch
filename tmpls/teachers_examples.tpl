<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>It would be great if the volunteer can demonstrate any kind of math <br />
  connection or science relation. Students would like to meet an enthusiastic <br />
  working engineer or scientist.<br />
  It would be wonderful if we could have someone come to speak on any aspect <br />
  of engineering.  How you prepared for your job is very helpful. Students also <br />
  need to hear what engineers actually DO! </p>
<p>Interested in having an engineer speak to my class about their career, and <br />
  university that they attended. Would prefer someone who comes from a <br />
  disadvantaged background, possibly speaks Spanish, but not necessary. <br />
  I would really appreciate a hands-on activity to demonstrate engineering <br />
  concepts to the students. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to <br />
  prepare the kids prior to the visit.<br />
  I would like my students to understand that Math can be used in all aspects of <br />
  life. I want my students to know what opportunities are available if they work <br />
  hard and apply themselves in higher levels of math!<br />
  It would be new to have an engineer to visit my classroom and talk about the <br />
  importance of the  math and sciences.<br />
  I would like for my students to be exposed to an engineer and hear about the <br />
  exciting projects that they work on.  I have a lot of young mathematicians in <br />
  my classroom, and having this exposure might motivate them to forge ahead <br />
  throughout their k-12 school years.</p>
<p>I would like someone to talk to them about the importance of writing and clear <br />
  communication in Enginering, as well as the demand and career opportunities <br />
  for engineers. We will be talking about careers and working on resumes.</p>
